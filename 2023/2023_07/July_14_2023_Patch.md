Welcome to Part 2 of July Midseason Update! Yep the Summer 2023 update for Live TF2 was unexpected. After asking to boba about community maps that were officially added into Live TF2, I've noticed the author of the workshop maps added into TF2 still belongs to map maker, not Valve.

After considering if we should keep Live TF2 maps or not, I made this decision: Screw the official status! Anyways, this update brings back several maps from Live TF2, which is the last version before Valve adds the map.

To prevent any further issues, this map will NOT receive any updates (except the critical fixes that needs to be addressed), and these maps can be removed at any time if map author or Valve dislikes to be added on this server. So keep that in mind!

An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

### Map Rotation Updates
* Reorganized structures for `mapcycles.txt`, and now it consists of three parts: TF2C Official Maps, Live TF2 Maps, Community Maps.
* Added new category: Live TF2 Maps
> These maps are taken from latest workshop version before Valve adds that map into the game. These maps will receive NO updates (except critical fixes), and can be removed at any time by the author/Valve's request.
* Added 26 new Live TF2 maps: Arena Byre, Arena Suijin, A/D Hardwood, A/D Mossrock, A/D Snowplow, Hybrid Sulfur, CP Metalworks, CP Process, CP Snakewater, CP Sunshine, CP Vanguard, KOTH Brazil, KOTH Cascade, KOTH Lazarus, KOTH Probed, KOTH Suijin, PL Borneo, PL Breadspace, PL Enclosure, PL Phoenix, PL Pier, PL Rumford, PL Snowycoast, PL Venice, PLR Bananabay
* Replaced KOTH Rotunda with latest Live TF2 patch
> TF2C version is way too outdated, and the author does not care anymore so we decided to replace it with latest Live TF2 workshop version.
* Moved KOTH Sharkbay, KOTH Rotunda, PL Cashworks into Live TF2 maps category as they are now part of Live TF2 maps
* Removed VIP Survival game mode due to lack of popularity and so many exploits

### Fixes
* Fixed some of official maps not being present on mapcycles file
* Fixed the case that bot players were allowed to choose blocked classes such as Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Spy
> These four classes are disabled as we are not bot focused server and works terribly for just one bot.
