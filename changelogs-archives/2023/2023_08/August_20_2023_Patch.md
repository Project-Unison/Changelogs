# August 20, 2023 Patch
An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

* Updated Markus_W's Improved Nav to August 19, 2023 update
8 Adjusted bot difficulty from Normal to Hard, this should prevent bots being stupid enough and at least try to be helpful while not making game excessively hard
* Adjusted ping limit from 190 to 220
* Reduced Sudden Death time limit from 1 min 30 seconds to 1 min as we are now fast-paced game
* Updated Ping limit plugin to active fork version, this should improve server performance and prevent anyone from being kicked immediately even with lower ping
