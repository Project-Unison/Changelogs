# August 6, 2023 Patch
An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

* Renamed `Custom Weapons` servers to `Hi-Speed Custom Weapons`
* Rebalanced some of weapons from Spacenaut's Armament Box
* Moved India (Mumbai) server to Frankfurt, Germany for TF2C servers only, due to high request from community and lack of players in India
> Servers for other games will remain on Mumbai server, this one is exception as there is lack of Asia players
