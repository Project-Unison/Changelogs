# August 23, 2023 Patch: #TeamFortressBirthdayWeek
Happy Birthday, Team Fortress! It has been 27 years since the original Quake Team Fortress mod was born. To celebrate the Team Fortress series birthday, we have replaced the 2Fort with Classic version during this week. Hope you enjoy the celebration!

An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

* Replaced 2Fort NeoCity to 2Fort Classic map
    * This change will last during August 24, 2023 ~ August 31, 2023
