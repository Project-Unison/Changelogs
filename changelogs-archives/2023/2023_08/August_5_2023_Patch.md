# August 5, 2023 Patch
An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

* Increased map time from 15 to 20
* Now extend map is possible 2 times, and each extension will make time increased by 20 minutes (Previously 1 time with 15 minutes)
> To prevent maps being played over and over again, we had to limit the maximum map extensions so people can play various maps without playing on a same map.
* Fixed issue related to custom weapons script not being downloaded for some players
* Added back `!nominate` command
> Removing `!nominate` command was bad idea, so I made decision to bring back the ability to nominate maps.
