* Relocated Server Location
    * EU Server has been shut down due to less popularity
    * New Server Location: Mumbai, India to server all peoples from Asia and Europe
    * Server has been split into two region: Server Alpha (Mumbai) and Server Beta (Dallas)
    * Added new Custom Weapons server on Server Alpha

    * Base movement speed for all classes increased by 25%

* Increased server stability and security, and as well as server size optimizations
* Reduced Map time from 30 minutes to 15 minutes
> Many people can get bored if they keep playing on same map. This change should prevent players keep playing on same map for long time, allowing to give other maps a chance to play several maps in short time.
* Removed `!nominate` command
> We have noticed that people can repeatedly pick specific popular maps, caused by this !nominate command. As Live TF2 Casual doesn't include a player to choose a map, hopefully this change should allow others to try new maps without players keep choosing the same map over and over again.
