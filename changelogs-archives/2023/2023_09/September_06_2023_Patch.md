# September 6, 2023: TF2C 2.1.2 Update
Here goes another Team Fortress 2 Classic update! Hope you enjoy the changes.

### Warning: Breaking Changes
* New-Old Weapons Pack is still based on Team Fortress 2 Classic 2.1.1 which is outdated. Currently we are waiting for SilentFox3 to update New-Old Weapons Pack. For now there might be unexpected bugs or glitches unless SilentFox3 updates their NOWP mod. Thank you for your patience!
* Currently Eminoma have temporarily disabled some optimizations regarding the Attribute Manager, in order to debug some crash related issues. Because of that you may experience performance issue during Team Fortress 2 Classic 2.1.2. Thanks for understanding!

### What's new?
* Updated Team Fortress 2 Classic to 2.1.2, which brings deprecation of legacy features with additional optimization and fixes, plus adjustments. [More details about changes can be found here.](https://tf2classic.com/?id=6264)
