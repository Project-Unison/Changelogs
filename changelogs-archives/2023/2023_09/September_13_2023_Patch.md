# September 13, 2023: New-Old Weapons Pack v2.7.5 - Patch 1
* Updated New-Old Weapons Pack to v2.7.5 Patch 1
    * Buffed the Councilman: Removed the damage penalty! It does 60 / 81 DMG at max rampup
    * Buffed the Ambassador: Increased range by about 50%, to 1800 hU's
    * HOPEFULLY FINALLY MAYBE got the stock Medigun and Kritzkrieg particles working
    * Updated the Attribute Listing again, hopefully for the last-last time
    * Fixed the Global Taunts RR file to include the new item classes
    * Fixed the Ambassador's crane to move while reloading in world
    * Added mag ejection to the Flechette Launcher
    * Fixed the Tool Gun having a missing tracer, and rolled in a fix to the crouchwalk animations being busted - thanks Tangerine Paint!
