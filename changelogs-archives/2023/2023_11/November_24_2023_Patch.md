# November 24, 2023 Patch: UnisonOS 2023.11-r2
* Unison64 is now Class Wars instead of vanilla
> Due to lack of players willing to test the environment, we made decision to switch the server game mode into something that everyone can enjoy. Screw balance, here we go Class Wars.
* Added two new commands: `!votekick` and `!votemute`
* Removed Saxton Hale due to issue with Class Wars
