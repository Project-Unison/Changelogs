# November 20, 2023 Patch
* Added bot player
  * If there is one player only in the game, a bot enemy player will spawn to fight against you instead
  * The bot player leaves automatically when another player joins the team
  * The bot uses several type of weapons, and more smarter compared with Live TF2 bot
  * For some gamemode(e.g. Payload Race) bot player may not move at all, so consider this as temporary method while waiting for players
* Removed server restart system as it isn't necessary
* Added maintained version of updater plugin which automatically updates the plugin without breakage (Thank you [Teamkiller324](https://github.com/Teamkiller324)!)
