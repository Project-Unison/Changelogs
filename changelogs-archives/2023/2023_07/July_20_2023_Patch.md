# July 20, 2023 Patch
An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

* Replaced MySQL Bans with SourceBans++, which allows you to temporarily mute/gag/ban players
> Please note that SourceBans++ web panel won't be available to public due to my limitation, and it serves as installation and tools and nothing else!
* Mute/Gag/Silence also gets synchronized unlike previous MySQL Bans
