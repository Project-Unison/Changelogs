# July 16, 2023 Patch
An update for Project Unison servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:

* Removed A/D Snowplow due to constant server crash on map load
* Removed [Crashed Map Recovery](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2339489) feature due to plugin causing disabled map from rotation being loaded
